# LoFFFS
Loss-of-Function Frequency Spectra Generation R Package
This is an R package that can generate site grequency spectra of LoF mutations based on the the functional status of the gene they lie on
and/or the position of the LoF mutation. This package suggests the isntallation of ggplot2 and scales for the graph generation but is not required
if you require only the raw data. Additionally, this package assumes that the data taken in is a vcf file in the format of the 1001 Arabidopsis 
TAIR 10 Genome.
