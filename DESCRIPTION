Description: A package for creating site-frequency specrtra of Loss-of-Function (LoF) mutations 
  based on the functional status of a gene and/or the position of the LoF mutation.This package
  assumes that you provide a vcf file in the format of the 1001 Arabidopsis TAIR10 Genome. Although
  ggplot2 and scales is required to generate the frequency spectra, it is not required if you desire
  only the raw data.
